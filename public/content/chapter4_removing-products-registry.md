Chapter 4: Removing products from the Gift Registry
---------------

Previously we extended our gift registry functionality so customer could be able to see a listing of the
products on each registry; but we are still missing a critical part of the functionality. Customers need
to be able to manage the content on their registry.

So far customers are able to create registries and add products to them, but currently there is no way for
customers to actually remove a product from a gift registry.
